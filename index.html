        <p> There are a lot of Democratic Nominee hopefuls for 2020. So many that we can't even remember all of their names. Use this Presidential Nominee Gipherator to help us get to know Dem better. Simply click on the candidate's button to see how strong their giphy game is! You can animate and pause our wannabe Commander in Chief by clicking each gif. </p>
        
        <p> Missing your favorite obscure candidate who probably shouldn't have joined the running? <a href = "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democratic-2020-candidates_n_5cdb577ce4b061f71b8759a9" target="_blank">Find a list of candidates here</a> and submit their name. You can also submit names of folks who haven't launched a campaign, because this is a Democracy! And if we learned anything in 2016, it's that in a Democracy any idiot can run for, and in fact be elected, President. </p>
